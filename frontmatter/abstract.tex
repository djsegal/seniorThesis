Shock Ignition is a form of ignition for Inertial Confinement Fusion, which promises gains that are nearly an order of magnitude larger than NIF baseline values.  Although a relatively new scheme, Shock Ignition has received a considerable amount of research attention due to its ability to be applied to currently implemented technology.

A major component of Shock Ignition is computational modeling. One fundamental problem involved in it is the timing of laser-induced shocks, so that they coalesce at the same radius of their target.  AHAB -- or Automated High-throughput computing Achieved with Batch processing -- was designed to help with this timing process.  It has since grown to be capable of conducting parameter sweeps for a large set of optimization studies and debugging processes.
